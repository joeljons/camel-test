Camel ActiveMQ Project
======================

This project embeds Apache ActiveMQ together with Apache Camel.
Correction: It did, but I commented it out in camel-context.xml.
Most of the fun stuff happens in that file.

To build this project use

    mvn install

To run this project use the following Maven goal

    mvn camel:run
